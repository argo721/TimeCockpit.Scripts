# Signal Data Export Sample

# Introduction

When [time cockpit](http://www.timecockpit.com) stores a user's activity log,
it encrypts the data with the user's signal data password. Therefore, nobody
else can read her activity log.

In some situations, it is useful to be able to export a user's activity log
and import it in a different user's account or even a different time cockpit
subscription. Such situations are for instance:

* Trainings
* Product demonstrations
* Standardized test scenarios

The script in this sample can be used to auto-generate a script that you
can use to recreate the activity log of a given day/device in any 
account you like. Additionally, you can import the activity log for a
different date than the one you exported it.

# How to Use the Script

## Exporting the Activity Log

The core export logic can be found in [ExportSignalsToScript.py](ExportSignalsToScript.py).
Typically, you do not need to change this script.

[SampleExport.py](SampleExport.py) shows how to use the export script to
export activity logs for specified dates and devices. Note that the
export script can generate a target file (*exportSignalsToFile* method)
or write the result into a stream (*exportSignalsToStream* method).
[SampleExport.py](SampleExport.py) contains examples for how to call
both methods.

The workflow for **exporting** looks like this:

* Find out the dates and devices you want to export using time cockpit's
  graphical calendar.

* Create a new, empty directory on your disk and save [ExportSignalsToScript.py](ExportSignalsToScript.py)
  and [SampleExport.py](SampleExport.py) there.

* Change your local copy of *SampleExport.py* so that it exports the
  dates and devices that you want to export.

* Start time cockpit with the user whose activity log you want to export.
  Note that you **will need the user's password and her signal data password**.
  It is **not possible** to export a different user's activity log even if you
  are a time cockpit administrator.

* Switch to time cockpit's *Customization* module. If you do not see this 
  module in time cockpit, the user is no time cockpit administrator. 
  Exporting the activity log **requires the scripting feature** of time cockpit.
  Only time cockpit administrators have access to it. So you need to at 
  least temporarily **give the user** whose activity log should be exported
  **administrative privileges**.

* Open and execute your local, adapted copy of *SampleExport.py*.

## Importing the Activity Log

Once you exported the activity log, you can use the resulting script files
to regenerate it in any other account or subscription.

The workflow fpr **importing** looks like this:

* Start time cockpit with the user into who you want to import the
  activity log. Note that you **will need the user's password and her 
  signal data password**. It is **not possible** to import into a 
  different user's activity log even if you are a time cockpit administrator.

* Switch to time cockpit's *Customization* module. If you do not see this 
  module in time cockpit, the user is no time cockpit administrator. 
  Importing the activity log **requires the scripting feature** of time cockpit.
  Only time cockpit administrators have access to it. So you need to at 
  least temporarily **give the user** whose activity log should be imported
  **administrative privileges**.

* Open the generated script in time cockpit (choose *Open / Open Python 
  Script* in the Ribbon).

* Uncomment and adapt the last two lines in the generated script as needed.

* Execute the script.

If you switch back to the calendar and reload all data, you should see
the imported activity log.

## Important Tips

If you need to import multiple times, you can delete the activity log
using time cockpits *Delete signals* wizard. You find it in the
calendar's Ribbon.
